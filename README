Assignment 2
Elaine Xu


Assignment 2 simulates a barber shop which has multiple barber threads and
multiple customer threads running at the same time utilizing pthreads.

I placed my print statements outside of the mutex lock, thus they appear to be
interleaved and out of sync sometimes. Placing the print statements out of the
lock appears to have higher performace on the system (shorter time in critical
section).

I ran the simulation for 5 minutes with average service time of 1200
milliseconds and standard deviation of 200ms. Assuming there are 3 barbers and
customers arrive on average every 400ms, to determine approximately how many
waiting-room chairs are required to avoid turning away customers.

My run outputs from the various wait-chairs runs are shown below. When running
with 1 or 2 waiting-chairs, the number of customers turned away is quite large
(10+). Then the average number of turning customers decreases as the number of
chair is added. When running with 3 waiting-chairs, average of 7 customers were
turned away, 6 customers for 4 chairs and so on. Until when running with 7
wait-chairs, there were no customers turned away. I recommond using 7 chairs to
avoid any turning customers.
